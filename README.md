Simple and lightweight Minecraft client for 1.8.9 (and in future, newer versions).

## Why?
There are many Minecraft clients, but they are usually closed source, and may contain malicious code.

There may be mod loaders like Forge and Fabric, which are perfectly good, but are not as simple and easy to use.

## Safety
I open sourced this client because not enough clients are open source (even OptiFine is closed source).

If you are suspicous, you can easily look through all the code.

This client has been tested by multiple people on Hypixel, and it disables disallowed mods automatically.
